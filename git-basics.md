# Git Basics
Code previews can be done with help of backtics "```", three of them before the code and after.
```
git add *file*
```
Git add will tell git to start tracking the changes of the file you add and prepare it for commit.

```
git commit
```
Takes a snapshot of our changes and saves it as a version of our code. Makes it possible to go back to previous versions of the code if we have to.
