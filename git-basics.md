# Git Basics
Code previews can be done with help of backtics "```", three of them before the code and after.
```
git add file
```
Git add will tell git to start tracking the changes of the file you add and prepare it for commit.

```
git commit -m "message"
```
Takes a snapshot of our changes and saves it as a version of our code. Makes it possible to go back to previous versions of the code if we have to.
```
git status
```
Checks the status of the files that have been changed or not.
```
git log
```
Gives you a list of the recent commit history.
